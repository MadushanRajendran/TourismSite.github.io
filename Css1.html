  <span class="border">#1 IT’S AN INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY COUNTRY</span>
  <p>Long after your holiday tan has faded and the spices are no longer tickling your nose and mouth, the thing that will stick with you most about Sri Lanka will be how friendly the locals are.
    In many ways, ‘friendly’ doesn’t even begin to describe how warm, genuinely kind, and generous Sri Lankan people are. As travellers, often default mode is to be cautious when someone approaches to ‘chat’, as so often this is the gateway to an attempted sale or scam. 
    But here, we are constantly caught off-guard by their radiant smiles, genuine desire to chat, to learn about each other’s cultures, or simply to help out someone who clearly wasn’t from around these parts. 
    Tuk tuk drivers surprise us with coconuts on long drives, fellow passengers help us manoeuvre our bags into safer positions on overcrowded trains, families welcome us into their homes for tea and a chat, and people go out of their way time and time again, of their own accord, to make sure we felt welcome.

    From hybrid cars to 4G networks and general infrastructure, the country is far more developed than most travellers generally assume when they first arrive.
    Tech entrepreneurship is also thriving here, with apps like PickMe (tuktuks) and Yoho Bed (accommodation) changing the way you can travel around the island.

  <span class="border">#3 DON’T LET ITS SIZE FOOL YOU, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO IN SRI LANKA</span>
  <p>For an island roughly the tiny size of Ireland, Sri Lanka packs a serious punch when it comes to diversity of things to see and do (which you can read all about here).
    Endless golden beaches with pumping surf ring the island’s lush, jungle-clad heart; bustling cities full of colour and spice give way to hidden palm-fringed hidden alcoves; timeless World Heritage sites dot all corners of the island, while Elephants and Leopards still roam national parks in abundance. 
    Then, there are the wonderfully friendly locals, the picturesque train rides, the tastiest cuisine you could gift your tastebuds with, and more than one vibrant and fascinating cultures steeped in ancient history and tradition. 
    It’s the kind of diversity entire continents dream of, and all packed into one small island in the Indian Ocean. Utopia, plain and simple.

  <span class="border">#4 IT’S PRETTY AFFORDABLE, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES</span>
  <p>In our experience, Sri Lanka is a pretty affordable travel destination, but its definitely pricier when you compare it with many of its neighbours.
    Food and transport is particularly cheap here, with our longest train ride (Jaffna to Colombo) only setting us back £1.47 each, and most local meals coming in between £1-3 per person.    
    The real budget breakers here are accommodation which we found to be pretty pricey both trips, with private rooms in guesthouses priced at about £15-25 per night, meals in the trendy cafes and restaurants dotting the southern coast (obviously!), and paying for guided tours, like safaris. 
    Again, compared to western pricing it’s still very much a budget destination, but for those travelling on a backpacker budget, it’s something to be aware of.

  <div class="caption">
  <span class="border">#6 THERE ARE TWO MONSOON PERIODS IN SRI LANKA</span>
  <p>Unusually for an island of its size, Sri Lanka experiences not just one, but two monsoon periods each year, affecting opposite sides of the island and alternate times of the year. 
    Obviously for travellers looking to see the most with as little rain as possible, this means a slightly more complicated itinerary-planning mission. The good news is though, that these rainy seasons are generally short, and sunshine and good beach weather can always be found somewhere on the island. 
    The main southwest monsoon, ‘Yala’, brings heavy wind and intense rains to the west (Colombo, Negombo, Kalpitiya), hill country (Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ella, Haputale, Adam’s Peak) , and southwest coastlines (Galle, Mirissa, Unawatuna, Tangalle, Yala National Park) from April/May through to August. 
    This tends to be the largest monsoon period on the island. Needless to say, peak travel season through these parts is during the dry season, from October to April. 
    The second monsoon, ‘Maha’, hits the east coast and northern regions (Trincomalee, Arugam Bay, Nilaveli, Jaffna) between October and February. By all accounts, much of the action shuts down over this time, so you’ll be hard-pressed to find much in the way of accommodation, restaurants, etc open.
    Depending on how long you have for your trip, you might want to focus on one side of the island to avoid crappy weather in others. If you’re keen to see as much as possible across the entire island, we’d recommend December-March, as it tends to be the driest across the country, including in the cultural triangle (Sigiriya / Pidurangala, Anuradhapura). 
    We’ve travelled in both April (sweltering and wet!), and November (lovely), and definitely recommend the latter.

  <div class="caption">
  <span class="border">#7 IT’S REALLY HOT, SO BE PREPARED </span>
  <p>One thing that remains constant in Sri Lanka’s weather patterns is that it’s pretty generally hot, all year-round. 
    Average temperatures island-wide range between 26-30c most months, and the humidity is intense beyond words. In fact, on our first trip to the island in April 2016 (which we later discovered tends to be the hottest month!), we found we had to get most of our sightseeing done before 10am, when the heat of the day became almost unbearable. 
    Be prepared; pack lots of light, loose-fitting clothing, sunscreen, your sunglasses, a hat, and always carry a full reusable water bottle - you’re going to need it!

  <span class="border">#8 SRI LANKA HAS A DIVERSE AND ANCIENT HISTORY</span>
  <p>Ancient kingdoms, multiple colonial heritages, and a civil war: Sri Lanka’s history is fascinatingly diverse and complex. 
    For thousands of years, this tiny fertile island was an important trading hub along the Silk Road route, the woody spice of its native cinnamon bark desired the world over. The immense power of the nation’s ancient Kingdoms can still be seen today, in the many UNESCO-protected ruins (Polonnoruwa, Sigiriya, and Anuradhapura) that dot the so-called cultural triangle of the centre of the country.
    In the 1500s, the first colonisers invaded; first Portuguese, then Dutch, and eventually British, bringing their religion and social class systems, extensive Fortifications and architecture - many of which can still be found today (particularly in Galle). Colonial rule lasted almost 450 years, until Sri Lanka were finally granted their independence in 1948.  
    Then came the fierce and bloody civil war, a drawn-out 25-year battle for independence by the Tamil Tigers of the north, from which the country has been trying to rebuild since 2009.
    It’s this diversity of Sri Lanka’s heritage that make it such a fascinating destination for those seeking a cultural, historical experience on their travels.
